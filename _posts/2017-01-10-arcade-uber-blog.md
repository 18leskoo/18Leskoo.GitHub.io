Qix:in this game you must draw lines across the screen until you get a majority of the screen covered however you have 2 sparkly things and an big colorful series of lines to stop you if the sparkly things touch you you die and if the lines touch the line you are making you die
Donkey kong:you are mario and have to rescue a  princess ,all that stands in your way is Donkey kong throwing things at you, in this game you must get to the top of the building using ladders jumping over the barrels and dodging the walking balls of fire
Frogger :like today's crossy road you cross a road and  rivers dodging cars and not stepping on alligators the further you get the higher your score is.
Hexxagon:You must flip over tiles to try to surround all the other players tiles this is played on an hexagonal board hence its name.
Simon:in this game you must look at what colours the screen flashes and then repeat them in order on an console in the middle of your screen.this is based on the game simon says.
Space invaders:in this game you are playing as a  defence tower and the aim of the game it to shoot down all the aliens before they reach earth. The aliens are descending slowly and are shooting projectiles at you. There are 4 green blocks which are there to protect you if you move under them but if anyone shoots at it it starts to disintegrate 
Tetris:in this game you must flip and move falling tiles so they go as far down as possible if your blocks pile up to the top you lose but if you fill up a row horizontally it disappears.
