    <td>when I was coding this lesson I felt like I did very well communicating with my partner, Ethan, we made sure we got to try out the navigating role a bit, as well as the other one, we made sure we worked fast cutting no shortcuts, we are one of if not the furthest along, we made sure there was nothing that could interrupt our learning, and we had a lot of fun doing it this Way.overall I felt like if I continue working like this I could be on the path to getting an good  grade.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>overall I think I worked well this lesson not being very distracted, but if I were to pick what I would like to improve is how fast I type, improving this could really help us in our speed and efficiency, but overall we did not talk much we got on with the task at Hand and did not distract ourselves and the only communication we had with other people was when we were helping them</td>

    <td>What did I do in the lesson</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was paired up with Ethan Lai for the duration of the fuze box project, and we are pair number 2 (so we can start extra early) we got off to an solid start with our simple hello world programs and we got faster and more effective as the lesson went on, our programming skills were improving fast as was out rock, we got through an lot in the lesson, with an few key learning points in the mix (like how we need to save the work more often, we lost our work multiple times, but managed to get back easily because we backed up every few lines of code, so no need for worry, but our organisational skills leave an lot to be desired) overall I am happy with the way things have gone so far.</td>
