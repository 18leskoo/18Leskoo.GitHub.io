    <td>yesterday I was working on codecademy in mr keens class, this was a welcome change to the repetitive writing of code in mr ampah Korsah s lesson, we are currently working on python in the lesson, so far it has been fun to work with the code and it has been rewarding, certainly more so than the fuze boxes, as I can clearly see my progression as the boxes have been ticked in the left hand corner, it feels really rewarding when I finish after struggling with a excersize for 20 minutes and finally get to the solution

    <td>I need to work just a little bit faster to make everything more efficient, and I need to make sure that I don't use the solution button on the exercises, if I do it it would be not very rewarding and not be good for my learning </td>

    <td>i think that overall I did pretty well, and I didnâ€™t leave my blog to the last minute ad I think that if I continue to work like this this term will be quite enjoyable, both for me and my classmates and anyone else who happens to be looking at my work.</td>
