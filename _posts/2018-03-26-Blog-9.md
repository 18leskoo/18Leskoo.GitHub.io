    <td>this lesson i worked on the electronic components kit with Ethan, the hardest part was not the code but putting the lights in the right place and the more lights there were the more complicated it became I had to work through lots of problems with the lights not turning on but I think that I worked around the problems well and I think that in the end it was worth it, I just think that it would be better if I didn't have to redo everything every lesson.

    <td>I need to work just a little bit faster to make everything more efficient when plugging everything in to make all the components work instead of wasting half the lesson trying to get the lightbulbs to work how I want you hem to.</td>
